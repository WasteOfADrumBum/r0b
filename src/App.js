        <p>
          This project exisits to show my passion for coding. It has been built
          with all my favorite libraries, languages and dependencies. I was
          motivated to put together a clean application that showcased the
          abilities of some of the most lucrative programming that's on the web
          today. I plan on periodically updating this page with fun new
          components and features to grow and develop my skillset in the
          information technology industry. As a web developer my abilities will
          only mature with my ability to learn and practice my skills when
          sharing them with the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Languages:</b> I chose to use React.js as the foundation of the
          user interface, Auth0 for the Authentication and authorization
          platform as well as Bootstrap's CSS Framework for developing a
          responsive and mobile-first website.

        <p>
          The beauty of JavaScript Standard Style is that it's simple. No one
          wants to maintain multiple hundred-line style configuration files for
          every module/project you work on.

            <ul>
              <li>
                No configuration. Enforce consistent style in a project. It's
                easy, just drop it in.
              </li>
              <li>
                Automatically format code. Say goodbye to messy or inconsistent

              <b>React</b> is an open-source JavaScript frontend framework for
              building an intuitive and interactive user interface. It is widely
              adopted and a top choice among developers because of its great
              performance and simplicity in the rapid development of Single-Page
              Applications.

              <b>MongoDB</b> is a schema-less NoSQL database that can receive
              and store data in JSON-like documents. It takes away the idea of
              thinking and visualizing a database table in rows and columns. It
              allows you to be more productive by building JavaScript
              applications in a JSON format, making it not strange to any
              JavaScript developer. It supports arrays and nested objects values
              and allows for flexible and dynamic schemas. It is often used with
              <b> Mongoose</b>, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, that
              helps to manage relationships between data and provides schema
              validations.

              developers when building large and complex programs by adding
